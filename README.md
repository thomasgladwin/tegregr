# tegregr
Multiple and hierarchical regression in Python.

The function teg_regression provides the overall model F-test and t-tests per coefficient, and also provides F-tests for change in explained variance from a baseline to a nested model. See example.py for usage. Results are reported by feeding the output object to teg_report_regr.

See example.py for usage; this also includes an illustration of how multicollinearity can induce potentially misleading effects. In this example, the dependent variable, y, is generated based on a predictor x1 plus noise:

y = x1 + np.random.randn(N)

A second predictor, x2, is generated by noise, and is unrelated to x1 and unrelated to y. However, adding a third predictor that is related to x1 and to x2 increases the rate of finding a significant regression coefficient for x2 in a model including all three predictors.
